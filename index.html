            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook
                and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development
                of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and
                rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional
                libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>

            <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <b>you can use as little or as much
                    React as you need</b>. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple
                HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
            </p>
            <h2>Online Playgrounds</h2>
            <p>If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello
                World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.</p>
            <p>If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it
                from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only
                recommend using this for simple demos.</p>
            <h2>Add React to a Website</h2>
            <p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">You can add React to an HTML page in one
                    minute.</a> You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic
                widgets.</p>
            <h2>Create a New React App</h2>
            <p>When starting a React project, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html"> a simple
                    HTML page with script tags</a> might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set
                up!<br>As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several
                JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no
                configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.<a

            <p>People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a
                more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.</p>
            <li>If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial.</li>
            <li>If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.</li>
            <h2>First Examples</h2>
            <p>The<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React homepage</a> contains a few small React examples with a live
                editor. Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects
                the result.</p>
            <h2>React for Beginners</h2>
            <p>If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check out <a
                    href="https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/">this overview of React by Tania
                    Rascia</a>. It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way.
                Once you’re done, give the documentation another try!</p>
            <h2>React for Designers</h2>
            <p>If you’re coming from a design background, <a href="https://reactfordesigners.com/">these
                    resources</a>are a great place to get started.</p>
            <h2>JavaScript Resources</h2>
            <p>The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t
                have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p>
            <p>We recommend going through this <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">JavaScript
                    overview</a> to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you
                will feel more confident learning React.</p>
            <h2>Practical Tutorial</h2>
            <p>If you prefer <b>to learn by doing,</b>check out our <a
                    href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">practical tutorial.</a> In this tutorial, we build
                a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not into building games —
                but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React
                apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.</p>
            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            <p>If you prefer <b>to learn concepts step by step,</b> our <a
                    href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">guide to main concepts</a> is the best place to
                start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won’t
                miss anything as you go along.</p>
            <h2>Thinking in React</h2>
            <p>Many React users credit reading <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">Thinking in
                    React</a> as the moment React finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough
                but it’s still just as relevant.</p>
            <h2>Recommended Courses</h2>
            <p>Sometimes people find third-party books and video courses more helpful than the official documentation.
                We maintain a list of commonly recommended resources, some of which are free.</p>
            <li><a href="https://blog.glitch.com/post/react-starter-kit">Glitch: React Starter Kit</a> - A free, 5-part
                video course with interactive code examples that will help you learn React.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101">Codecademy: React 101</a> - Codecademy’s
                introductory course for React.</li>
            <li><a href="https://ui.dev/free-react-bootcamp/">Free React Bootcamp</a> - Recordings from three days of a
                free online React bootcamp.</li>
            <li><a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact">Scrimba: Learn React for free</a> - 48 hands-on video
                tutorials building react apps.</li>
            <h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>
            <p>Once you’re comfortable with the main concepts and played with React a little bit, you might be
                interested in more advanced topics. This section will introduce you to the powerful, but less commonly
                used React features like context and refs.</p>
            <h2>API Reference</h2>
            <p>This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more details about a particular React API.
                For example, React.Component API reference can provide you with details on how setState() works, and
                what different lifecycle methods are useful for.</p>
            <p>React lets you define components as classes or functions. Components defined as classes currently provide
                more features which are described in detail on this page. To define a React component class, you need to
                extend React.Component:</p>
            <code>class Welcome extends React.Component {
                render() {
                  return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
                }
              }</code>
            <h2>Glossary and FAQ</h2>
            <p>The glossary contains an overview of the most common terms you’ll see in the React documentation. There
                is also a FAQ section dedicated to short questions and answers about common topics, including making
                AJAX requests, component state, and file structure.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="JSX:_JavaScript_+_XML">
        <header>JSX: JavaScript + XML</header>
        <article>
            <p>As you've seen, we've been using what looks like HTML in our React code, but it's not quite HTML. This is
                <b>JSX</b>J, which stands for JavaScript XML.
            </p>
            <p>With JSX, we can write what looks like HTML, and also we can create and use our own XML-like tags. Here's
                what JSX looks like assigned to a variable.</p>
            <code>
                const heading = <h1 className="site-heading">Hello, React</h1></code>
            <p>Using JSX is not mandatory for writing React. Under the hood, it's running <code>createElement</code>,
                which takes the tag, object containing the properties, and children of the component and renders the
                same information. The below code will have the same output as the JSX above.</p>
            <code>const heading = React.createElement('h1', {className: 'site-heading'}, 'Hello, React!')</code>
            <p>JSX is actually closer to JavaScript, not HTML, so there are a few key differences to note when writing
                it.</p>
            <li><code class="language-text">className</code> is used instead of <code class="language-text">class</code> for adding CSS classes, as
                <code class="language-text">class</code> is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase - <code class="language-text">onclick</code> will become <code class="language-text">onclick</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Self-closing tags must end in a slash - e.g. <code class="language-text">< img /></code></li>

            <p>JavaScript expressions can also be embedded inside JSX using curly braces, including variables,
                functions, and properties.</p>
            <code>const name = 'Tania'
                const heading = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1></code>

            <p>JSX is easier to write and understand than creating and appending many elements in vanilla JavaScript,
                and is one of the reasons people love React so much.</p>
